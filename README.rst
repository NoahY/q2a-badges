Translation
-----------

.. _Translation:

The translation file is **qa-lang-badges.php**.  Copy this file to the **qa-lang/<your-language>/** directory.  Edit the right-hand side strings in this file with notepad2, notepad++, etc. (don't ever use Window's Notepad. For anything. Ever.), for example, changing:

**'good_question'=>'Good Question',**

to

**'good_question'=>'Swali nzuri',**

for Swahili.  Don't edit the string on the left-hand side or bad things will happen.

Once you've completed the translation, don't forget to set the site language in the admin control panel... to Swahili.  

-------------
Custom Badges
-------------

.. _Custom Badges:

Custom badges may be implemented in any plugin module in a similar way as option_default.  Steps are as follows:

1. create a function in your module class called **custom_badges()**.  It should return an array of badges with the badge slugs as indexes for nested arrays with *var* (default requirement) and *type* (bronze=0,silver=1,gold=2) indexes.  Here is an example from the comment-voting plugin:
::
		function custom_badges() {
			return array(
				'nice_comment' => array('var'=>2, 'type'=>0),
				'good_comment' => array('var'=>5, 'type'=>1),
				'great_comment' => array('var'=>10, 'type'=>2)
			);
		}
		
2. create a function in your module class called **custom_badges_rebuild()** that will award badges when rebuilding via admin/plugins and return the number of badges awarded.  Here is an example from the comment-voting plugin:
::
		function custom_badges_rebuild() {
			$awarded = 0;
			
			$posts = qa_db_query_sub(
				'SELECT userid, postid, netvotes FROM ^posts WHERE type=$ AND netvotes>0',
				'C'
			);
			while ( ($post=qa_db_read_one_assoc($posts,true)) !== null ) {
				$badges = array('nice_comment','good_comment','excellent_comment');
				$awarded += count(qa_badge_award_check($badges,(int)$post['netvotes'],$post['userid'],$post['postid'],2));
			}
			return $awarded;
		}

3. implement **qa_register_plugin_phrases()** via your qa-plugin.php, including two entries for each badge: *badge_<slug>* and *badge_<slug>_desc*.  Here is an example from the comment-voting plugin:
::
	return array(
		'permit_vote_c' => 'Vote on comments',
		'badge_nice_comment' => 'Nice Comment',
		'badge_good_comment' => 'Good Comment',
		'badge_great_comment' => 'Great Comment',
		'badge_nice_comment_desc' => 'Comment received +# upvote',
		'badge_good_comment_desc' => 'Comment received +# upvote',
		'badge_great_comment_desc' => 'Comment received +# upvote',
	);

4. Create your own mechanism for awarding badges - see some examples in the badges plugin code, or the bookmark plugin.  Make sure to test for both ``qa_opt('badge_active')``, which makes sure the badge plugin is active, and ``qa_opt('badge_custom_badges')`` to make sure the badge plugin version supports custom badges.   Use the function ``qa_badge_award_check()`` to check for badges, where $badges is an array of badge slugs, $var is the number to test against the badges, $oid is the postid (if any), $notify = 0 for no notification, 1 for email and popup, 2 for just popup.  You should probably check if this function exists as well, in case the badge plugin has been deleted while active.
